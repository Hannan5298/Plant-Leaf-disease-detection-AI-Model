# Plant-Leaf-disease-detection-AI-Model
This project is an AI model for detecting plant leaf diseases using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) architecture. The model is built using Python and the Keras library, and is trained on a dataset of images of healthy and diseased plant leaves. The trained model is then integrated into a web application using FastAPI to allow users to test the model's accuracy on their own images.
